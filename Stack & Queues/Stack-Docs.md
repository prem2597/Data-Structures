- Linked list in java : 
    - Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package. 
    - This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
    - The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. 
    - Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays. 
    - It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from the head and follow through the link to reach to a node we wish to access.
