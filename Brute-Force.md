- To record the time

- various timing for the number of inputs

- standard plot defines the time taken taken with respect to the number of inputs as the number of inputs increases the time taken for the solution is incresing exponentially

- the below mentioned is the logarithmic graph for the above exponential graph

Here compare the equation with y = mx + c formuala
where b is the slope in the above equation and log(T(N)) is the y value, log N is the x value  and c is the constant.

- There are two main reasons to use logarithmic scales in charts and graphs. The first is to respond to skewness towards large values; i.e., cases in which one or a few points are much larger than the bulk of the data. The second is to show percent change or multiplicative factors.

- Regression : Regression takes a group of random variables, thought to be predicting Y, and tries to find a mathematical relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) that best approximates all the individual data points.

- so based on the above hypothesis we are predicting the number of input based on the execution time.
